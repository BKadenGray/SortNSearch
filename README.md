# SortNSearch

This project holds the capability to do the following:
 ```
    - Setup an array one digit at a time
    - Print the array
    - Sort the array using three different methods (Quick, Merge, Shell)
    - Search the array for a target using two different methods (Binary, Interpolation)
```

The user will use the menu system to begin the program and use this to create and array and sort and search as they wish.

Example arrays:

[59, 21, 3, 67, 89, 15, 72]

```
   - [1, 2, 2, 3, 9, 25, 29, 33, 45, 93, 99]

   - [3, 15, 21, 59, 67, 72, 89]
```
